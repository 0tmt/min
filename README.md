# Min

Welcome to min a simple Jekyll theme. First & foremost min is a Jekyll theme creating your own custom designs. It's partially built on <a href="http://getpoole.com/">Poole</a> another great starter theme for Jekyll. However it does have a few other features such as compiling Sass(.scss). Feel free to check out a demo of min <a href="http://dbelt93.github.io/min/">here</a>.

Right now this theme is a bit rough around the edges. If you find any issues, have some thoughts about improving it, or just want to tell me it sucks feel free to get in touch.

###### Running Locally
I'm not going to explain how to run Jekyll & min locally simply because I don't run them locally. However here are some guides explaining the basics of getting Jekyll setup locally.
