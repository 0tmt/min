# Min

Welcome to min a simple Jekyll theme. First & foremost min is a Jekyll theme creating your own custom designs. It's partially built on Poole another great starter theme for Jekyll. However it does have a few other features such as comping Sass(.scss).

## Getting Started

#### Fork This Repo
If you want to get going right away simply fork this repo into your own repositories. The from there go to the config.yml file and set the "url", and "baseurl" accordingly.

#### Running Locally
I'm not going to explain how to run Jekyll & min locally simply because I don't run them locally. However here are some guides explaining the basics of getting Jekyll setup locally.
