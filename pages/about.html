<p>Hello there my name is Daniel Belt I'm a web designer from Mattoon, Il, and I'm the creator of MIN. I love Jekyll for building websites however I have a Windows machine. And for those who know anything about ruby know sometimes it can be diffuclt to install gems on Windows. So I decided to create a Jekyll theme that was extremely simply, and a starting point for other projects. While also making sure I could easily edit anything I needed in the cloud.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 50px;">This theme was actually built on poole. Most of the code has been stripped out or changed, but I really wanted to create something on a solid foundation since I don't have a lot knowledge of Jekyll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 50px;">If you have any questions about min feel free to get in touch: dbelt93 at gmail.com</p>
