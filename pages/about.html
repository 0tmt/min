<p>Hello there my name is Daniel Belt the creator of MIN. When creating this theme I really wanted to build a Jekyll theme that would be a great starting point for project and client sites.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 50px;">This theme was actually built on poole. Most of the code has been stripped out or changed, but I really wanted to create something on a solid foundation since I don't have a lot knowledge of Jekyll.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 50px;">If you have any questions about min feel free to get in touch: dbelt93 at gmail.com</p>
