<p>MIN is a Jekyll theme for people who want a starting point for building their own themes, and of course working in the browser. The main motvation for this theme came from not founding a theme to be a great starting point, and having issues installing ruby on my Windows laptop.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 15px;">This theme was actually built on poole. Most of the code has been stripped out or changed, but I really wanted to create something on a solid foundation since I don't have a lot knowledge of Jekyll.</p>
