<p>Welcome to min a simple Jekyll theme built on <a style="font-weight: 700;" href="http://getpoole.com/">Poole</a>. I created this theme to be a starting point for creating my own custom Jekyll themes.
<br><br>
min is built on Poole which is another great starter theme, however there a few aspects I simpy didn't need, and some I did. So I took Poole as a foundation then began removing certain features while adding others.
<br><br>
If you want you can download min right here, or view the source on github.
